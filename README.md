# FirstProject - *WeBuyAnyCar*   
My very first python project ever, again with DigitalFutures!

**Context** - here's the scenario. My team and I were given the task of creating a user input function that would suggest the price of a car based on various features
such as ULEZ-compliance, mileage, age etc. Basically metrics provided in the actual autotrader website (which was webscraped to acquire the data). Calculations would be
done by the linear regression model we would produce.
   
**Contents** - The first code file Final_LG_model contains all the EDA, and model creation processes for the project. The second file at the very end contains the user input function.
Looking back, the user input function is not very good! But it's nothing while loops and try: and except: branches can't fix :)
